2016/11/07 -	Sagan 1.1.3 released.

	        * New "dynamic_load" processor.  This allows rules to be created that can load other rules.  For example,  it is now possible to "detect" new logs coming in and have Sagan automatically load rules for them.
	        * PCRE JIT support added.  This allows faster PCRE processing if your library supports it.
	        * Modifications to the configure.ac to detect different PCRE library versions and functions.  This was taken from the Suricata project. 
		  https://github.com/beave/sagan/commit/04c74d56ac1eff7679636c16fdf853ae4e70c23a
	        * Fixed bug that caused a segfault on reload (SIGHUP). 
	          https://github.com/beave/sagan/commit/87cd03dc1887e4fa1cef385974180cac77ca1c2d
		* Code clean up/redefinition of _Sagan_Event and _Sagan_Proc_Syslog arrays.

2016/09/23 -    Sagan 1.1.2 released.

                * Added "srcport" for "threshold" and "after".  
                * Fixes around "dstport" for threshold" and "after"
                * Fixed display of source/destination IP addresses in tools/sagan-peek.c
                * Change "artistic" style from "GNU" to "Linux".  This allows better formatting of source code on smaller screens.
                * New pthread mutex to address corruptions of mmap / files.
                * tools/sagan-peek.c now has command line option to specify mmap file location. Various other improvements.
                * Better error checking in src/processors/sagan-track-clients.c
                * New MD5, SHA1 and SHA256 in src/parsers/parse-hash.c
                * Minor Bluedot lookup fixes. 
                * Fixes for "after" and "threshold" when dealing with "usernames". (Username tracking).
                * Added "file" option for sagan.conf to reference a file to load.  For example, "var MYVAR file:/path/to/my/values.txt".

2016/07/06 -    Sagan 1.1.0 released.

		The Basics:
		-----------

		* Sagan now "remembers" where it left off between restarts/reboots/etc.
		* You can now create rules that focus on certain IP address or IP address ranges (ie - $EXTERNAL_NET/$HOME_NET).
		* Sagan can treat "old" Bluedot IP reputation threat Intel differently than "new" threat intel.
		* We added "qdee.pl",  a SDEE poll routine to the "extra" directory.
		* A lot of bugs were fixed 

		The Details:
		------------

		* Moved all "threshold", "after", "flowbits", and "client tracking" to mmap files.  This means that Sagan "remembers" between restarts where it "left off"! 
		* Introduced "tools/sagan-peek.c" which allows you to exmaine Sagan mmap files.  Useful in debugging or just "seeing" what Sagan is "tracking".
		* $EXTERNAL_NET and $HOME_NET now function as expected.  Previous versions of Sagan did not have any concept of $EXTERNAL_NET/$HOME_NET and were ignored.  Adam Hall @ Quadrant made Sagan "aware" of "traffic flow".  Values in a rule for source/destination are tested _after_ normalization.
		* Added "mdate" (modification date) and "cdate" (creation data) to Bluedot. This allows Sagan to not trigger "aged" Bluedot Threat Intel.  For example, do _not_ alert if an IP address is seen and the Intel is over X hours/days/months/years old.
		* Threholding based on 'dstport' merged,  thanks to Bruno Coudoin.  See:  https://github.com/beave/sagan/commit/44d6752acf27d61bcd57e35f930b0f6e11dadbc7
		* Added parsing for IPTables "SPT" and "DPT"t port for iptables, thanks to Bruno Coudoin.  https://github.com/beave/sagan/commit/9de9cffd224a44f93c80eca62e6ead617a4b97a6
		* Added "qdee" to the "extra" directory.  This allows Sagan to parse older style Cisco IDS output.  This polls using the SDEE protocol. See https://github.com/beave/sagan/commit/61c4a7dd611161697785c889630dd3c8333ec8b5
		* Removed support for libjsonc (json-c) and moved to libfastjson.

		The Bugs Fixed:
		---------------

		* Correct issue for when Sagan cannot open a file (-F/--file) due to permissions.
		* Removed unused "SigArgs" array.
		* Clean exit when Sagan cannot load Maxmind GeoIP2 data file.
		* Change "normalize: {type}" to "normalize;".  All normalization rules now come from one file.  This keeps Sagan in line with liblognorm development.
		* Sagan now "warns" the user if old style "normalize" is encountered. See: https://github.com/beave/sagan/commit/ba3de9e43bc8623b361e34ce06a2e7808e045f88 and https://github.com/rsyslog/liblognorm/issues/206
		* Fix json_object_object_get_e) compile time warnings. See: https://github.com/beave/sagan/commit/e9bdea5b7fa5b25c1d7e740a4c856c70a1046d1d
		* Minor ARM CPU fixes.
		* Various "meta_content" fixes.  When using "meta_content" with large amounts of search data would sometimes cause failures. 
		* Major bug fixes involving "client tracking".  Thanks to Adam Hall @ Quadrant Information Security!
		* Sagan now attempts to create the FIFO if it is not detected.  Thanks to Cabrol Perales.
		* A lot of smaller bug fixes.  See: https://github.com/beave/sagan/commits/master

2015/11/19 - 	Sagan 1.0.1 released.

		* Add unified2 "extra data" field to store the orignal syslog
		  source.
		* Added threshold by "username". 
		* Minor code clean up. 

2015/10/23 -    Sagan 1.0.0 released.
